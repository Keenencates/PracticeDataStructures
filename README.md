# PracticeDataStructures
This repository is my collection of data structures that I have implemented in preparation for interviews/jobs.

+ singly linked lists
	+ implemented solution to mth-to-last element
	+ followed the implementation on pseudomuto.com
	+ learned how to code generics into C
	+ Potential to add doubly linked lists
	+ Potential to add circular lists
+ doubly linked lists
+ stacks


Upcoming Data Structures
----------------------------

* hash tables (using linked lists)
* doubly linked lists
